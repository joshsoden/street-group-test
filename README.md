###Â PHP .csv reader

This is a small console PHP application for parsing a CSV file of homeowner names.

## Running the application
1. Ensure that the .csv file is named "homeowners.csv" (although the example file is included in the repository already)
2. Open the console in the same directory as the app
3. Run `php app.php` in the console

You will see the values in the console where you run the app.
